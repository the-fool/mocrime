Project Brief
--------
1.	I need to go to court to contest a ticket. I remember exactly where I was pulled over - I take the same route to school most days - but I'm not sure which court services the area and I know some courts serve multiple municipalities. I can’t figure out where I need to go for court or how to get help with my case.

Now I can’t remember when my court date is, and I’m not sure who to call. To be honest, I’d like to pay for the ticket right now without going to court, but there doesn’t seem to be a way.

3.	I owe fines and fees for several violations. I don’t make enough money at my job to be able to afford to pay – but I am already active volunteering in my community and caring for my neighbors. I wish I knew whether I was eligible to do community service instead of paying fines and fees, how to get credit for volunteer work, and how to connect with service opportunities that work with my family.4.	My license is suspended because I was caught with expired plate tags. I couldn’t renew my plates because I couldn’t afford to pay my fines, fees and personal property taxes, which I must pay all at once. I am working two jobs to earn money – but they are both a half hour drive away and I can’t afford to get pulled over with a suspended license. I’d also like to know whether there’s a warrant out for my arrest, and how to resolve it.5.	I’m a court clerk. I pride myself on providing good service at our court. To help with this, I’d like to know key analytics, such as how long people have to wait in court, and how that compares to other courts and our past performance.
